  ## Description
  With the help of my friends, family, and collegues the easy note taker was created. It took many tries for me to finally get this to work. With everyone being so busy these days at home or at work this is an application which makes it easy to store, track, and delete notes to keep yourself on track through the day.

  - Click on get started 
  - Then give your note a title 
  - Fill in what ever your note is 
  - Click the save button that is in the top right corner
  - When you click on the note it reappears in the input section
  - Click delete once the task is complete (little trash can at the end of your note title)
  - Repeat as many times as you wish
